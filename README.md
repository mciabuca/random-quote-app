# Random Quote App

This is a simple React application that fetches random quotes from an API and displays them. Users can also tweet the displayed quote.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mciabuca/random-quote-app.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd random-quote-app
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```sh
npm start
```

The application will start and can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

To run the tests, use:

```sh
npm test
```

## Deployment

To build the application for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the production-ready application.

## Future Features

Here are some features I am planning to add in the future:

1. Ability to favorite quotes and view them later.
2. User authentication to allow users to have personalized experiences.
3. Integration with more quote APIs to increase the variety of quotes.
4. A daily quote feature, where users get a new quote every day.
